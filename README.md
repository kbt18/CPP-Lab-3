# MSc Lab 3 - Chess

Code for the third C++ lab exercise. The purpose of this exercise is to focus on good object oriented design by building a chess engine. For example, I have chosen to use a base class `ChessPiece`, with the other pieces inheriting from this class.

# Usage
After compiling using the makefile, an executable `chess` is created. Moves are specified in `ChessMain.cpp`.
